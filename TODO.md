## Current Milestone: Maintenance Sweep: useSavedPokemon Split & Housekeeping

Planned 2026-10-19, off the back of Profile Social Scoping & Maintenance
shipping the same day (see `MILESTONES.md`). Nothing was queued in
Unscheduled/Future Milestones, so this milestone was scoped fresh from a
maintenance audit rather than bundled from pre-existing items.

Done when:
- No live, non-archived, non-generated/data-table file exceeds the 500-line
  hard cap (closes `useSavedPokemon.ts` at 685 lines — the next file-cap
  violation in line after `useTeams.ts`). **Met** — see Leg 1.
- The three known change-history comments (`App.tsx:83`,
  `TeamOverflowMenu.tsx:98`, `pokeapi.test.ts:55` — flagged in the
  2026-10-16 Project Revision v2 audit, never swept) are gone, plus a
  bounded spot-check of other likely candidates. **Met** — see Leg 2.
- The stored-snapshot-vs-live-recompute bug class (hit twice now —
  `spriteUrl`, then the profile-section resync bug) has been checked
  against current persisted-field read paths, with findings written down
  even if the finding is "no other instances." **Met** — see Leg 3.

All three Done-when criteria are now met; this milestone is ready for
`/close-milestone`.

(Leg 3 — Stored-Snapshot Audit — shipped 2026-10-19, see COMPLETED.md.)

Working task list for ongoing/planned work. Every item is titled
`[Item/Sweep Name] — Leg N` (say "Start [title]" to kick off a session on
it). Bodies stay short — commit-message-body length, not an investigation
log; deep cross-checks/history belong in `docs/investigations/<topic>.md`,
linked from the item. `Last touched` + `Re-checks` are tracked per item; no
status enum otherwise — absence of a `Blocked:` line means open. Blocked
items are exempt from the re-check counter and live in their own tier below
rather than mixed into the active list. This file adopted that format as of
2026-08-31 — all re-check counters started at 0 then regardless of how long
an item had been sitting. Reordered into priority order 2026-08-31; within
the current milestone and "Unscheduled", items are listed highest-to-lowest
priority. Only one milestone is "current" at a time — see root `CLAUDE.md`'s
Task Tracking rules for the full section-lifecycle (`## Current Milestone:
<name>` → `MILESTONES.md` + `COMPLETED.md` on ship). Finished work moves to
[COMPLETED.md](COMPLETED.md).

## Blocked

Items where the whole item (not just a sub-part) is stalled on something
outside this project — a person, a dependency, or an external decision.
Exempt from the re-check counter; they move back to "In progress" once
unblocked.

- **[In-App Auto-Update: macOS] — Leg 1** *(Last touched: not recorded ·
  Re-checks: 0)*
  Blocked: user needs a paid Apple Developer account ($99/yr) + notarization.
  Windows shipped in v0.2.1 (see COMPLETED.md). macOS is blocked: Squirrel.Mac
  (what `electron-updater` uses there) requires code signing to auto-update
  at all, and Gatekeeper heavily restricts unsigned builds regardless. Once
  unblocked, `registerAutoUpdater()`'s `process.platform !== 'win32'` guard
  in `main.ts` is the one line to revisit.
  - Separately, a paid Windows code-signing cert (~$100-400+/yr) isn't
    required for Windows auto-update to function, but would remove the
    SmartScreen warning — not yet decided.

- **[TypeScript 7 Upgrade] — Leg 1** *(Last touched: not recorded ·
  Re-checks: 0)*
  Blocked: waiting on real `typescript-eslint` 7.x support.
  `typescript-eslint` doesn't support TypeScript 7.0.2 yet (confirmed
  peer-range rejection + real runtime crash reports). Currently on
  TypeScript ^6.0.3.

## Unscheduled (not yet scoped, highest-to-lowest priority)

- **[useSavedPokemon Sync Doesn't Migrate Incoming Records] — Leg 1**
  *(Last touched: 2026-10-19 · Re-checks: 0)*
  Found during Split useSavedPokemon.ts's `/leg-review`:
  `reconcileSyncedSavedPokemon` (utils/savedPokemonSyncReconciliation.ts)
  never runs an incoming sync `records` entry through
  normalizeSavedPokemon/bumpUpdatedAtForFixedEntries before it can win a
  merge or get appended, unlike `reconcileSyncedTeams`'s
  normalizeIncomingSyncTeam step on the Teams side - a pre-migration
  device's stale data can land (and get persisted) here. Pre-existing gap,
  not introduced by that split. See
  `.claude/rules/sync-merge-migration-parity.md`. Done check: either fix
  (mirror normalizeIncomingSyncTeam) or confirm no still-live pre-migration
  devices make this moot, with the finding written down either way. Review:
  yes (sync reconciliation). Manual verification: no.

(The four items previously listed here were bundled into the Profile Social
Scoping & Maintenance milestone on 2026-10-19, now shipped; see
`MILESTONES.md`.)

## Future Milestones (unscheduled)

Profile System Revamp: Previews & Import was promoted to current
2026-10-18 and shipped the same day (see `MILESTONES.md`) - its Leg 5
manual-review follow-ups split back out to Unscheduled above, with
Profile Section Drag-and-Drop Between Open/Closed flagged as the pick for
the next milestone's planning.

Profile Editing & Visibility Controls (the milestone built from that pick)
was promoted to current 2026-10-18 and shipped 2026-10-19 (see
`MILESTONES.md`) - its own Leg 5 absorbed a planned Leg 6 and, per live
feedback mid-leg, reversed the milestone's Leg 4 Edit-mode toggle back to
always-on editing (see
`docs/postmortems/profile-editing-and-visibility-controls.md`). No new
follow-ups split out of this one beyond the `[Split useTeams.ts]` item
already above, now flagged for a third consecutive milestone.

`src/renderer/_archived/battle-logger/hooks/useBattleLogActions.ts` (1,001
lines) is also over the 500-line hard cap flagged by the Project Revision v2
audit (`docs/investigations/project-revision-v2-audit.md`), but it's dead/
archived code, not a live split candidate — the other four files that audit
flagged are now legs under the Maintenance & Code Health Sweep milestone
above.

2026-09-10 feedback pass batched into 4 candidate milestones; Battle Logger
Overhaul, Statistics Improvements, and Team Management QoL were each
promoted to current and have since shipped (see `MILESTONES.md`). Live Calc
Tuning, the last of the four, was promoted 2026-09-11 and later retired in
favor of Regular Calc Popup (see `MILESTONES.md`). VGCPastes real-set
sourcing, deferred out of Regular Calc Popup, was itself promoted to
current 2026-09-14 and shipped 2026-09-15 (see `MILESTONES.md`).

UI Shift Assessment Sweep — Post Card UI Polish, dropped as stale
2026-10-17 (last touched 2026-09-08, never scoped past its open-ended
framing). Any future UI-focused requests get scoped fresh as needed rather
than carrying this placeholder forward.

Password reset flow, deferred out of Web Version: Teams & Box MVP's scoping
(2026-09-29, see `docs/investigations/web-version-scope.md`) - not yet
worth its own leg: needs a transactional email API + SPF/DKIM
deliverability setup on a dedicated vannyproductions.com subdomain.

Public Profiles & Team Sharing was promoted to current 2026-10-17 and
shipped the same day (see `MILESTONES.md`) - its original leg 4 (shared
public team browse/upload database) split back out to Unscheduled above
since its moderation model still needs its own scoping pass.

Public route bundle split (noted 2026-10-18, during Profile Page Sections &
Layout Leg 3's routing discussion): `/u/<username>` currently shares the
main `web/` bundle with the full signed-in app (`web/main.tsx` statically
imports both `AppWeb` and `PublicProfilePage`) rather than being a
dedicated lightweight bundle the way `web/download/` is - `PublicProfilePage`
just never calls the heavier Teams/Box/sync hooks, so the "no app state for
anonymous visitors" goal is achieved at the runtime-behavior level, not the
bundle-size level (an anonymous `/u/<username>` visitor still downloads the
entire app bundle). Worth splitting into a dedicated `web/public/` Vite
entry (served via the same `404.html` redirect trick `/u/<username>`
already uses, since it needs a dynamic path segment `web/download/`
doesn't) once a second public dynamic route actually gets built - e.g.
public team displays not tied to a profile. Not worth restructuring the
build for a pattern with only one real example today.
