# ChoiceBuds TODO

Working task list for ongoing/planned work. Every item is titled
`[Item/Sweep Name] — Leg N` (say "Start [title]" to kick off a session on
it). Bodies stay short — commit-message-body length, not an investigation
log; deep cross-checks/history belong in `docs/investigations/<topic>.md`,
linked from the item. `Last touched` + `Re-checks` are tracked per item; no
status enum otherwise — absence of a `Blocked:` line means open. Blocked
items are exempt from the re-check counter and live in their own tier below
rather than mixed into the active list. This file adopted that format as of
2026-08-31 — all re-check counters started at 0 then regardless of how long
an item had been sitting. Reordered into priority order 2026-08-31; within
the current milestone and "Unscheduled", items are listed highest-to-lowest
priority. Only one milestone is "current" at a time — see root `CLAUDE.md`'s
Task Tracking rules for the full section-lifecycle (`## Current Milestone:
<name>` → `MILESTONES.md` + `COMPLETED.md` on ship). Finished work moves to
[COMPLETED.md](COMPLETED.md).

Current milestone: **Fixes & Adjustments** (opened 2026-10-03) — general
fixes and adjustments across the app, not limited to macOS. MacBook Pass
shipped the same day (see `MILESTONES.md` and its
[post-mortem](docs/postmortems/macbook-pass.md)).

## Current Milestone: Fixes & Adjustments

Legs are added as issues are reported. First batch reported 2026-10-03
(desktop and/or web).

## Blocked

Items where the whole item (not just a sub-part) is stalled on something
outside this project — a person, a dependency, or an external decision.
Exempt from the re-check counter; they move back to "In progress" once
unblocked.

- **[In-App Auto-Update: macOS] — Leg 1** *(Last touched: not recorded ·
  Re-checks: 0)*
  Blocked: user needs a paid Apple Developer account ($99/yr) + notarization.
  Windows shipped in v0.2.1 (see COMPLETED.md). macOS is blocked: Squirrel.Mac
  (what `electron-updater` uses there) requires code signing to auto-update
  at all, and Gatekeeper heavily restricts unsigned builds regardless. Once
  unblocked, `registerAutoUpdater()`'s `process.platform !== 'win32'` guard
  in `main.ts` is the one line to revisit.
  - Separately, a paid Windows code-signing cert (~$100-400+/yr) isn't
    required for Windows auto-update to function, but would remove the
    SmartScreen warning — not yet decided.

- **[TypeScript 7 Upgrade] — Leg 1** *(Last touched: not recorded ·
  Re-checks: 0)*
  Blocked: waiting on real `typescript-eslint` 7.x support.
  `typescript-eslint` doesn't support TypeScript 7.0.2 yet (confirmed
  peer-range rejection + real runtime crash reports). Currently on
  TypeScript ^6.0.3.

## Unscheduled (not yet scoped, highest-to-lowest priority)

- **[UI Shift Assessment Sweep — Post Card UI Polish] — Leg 1** *(Last
  touched: 2026-09-08 · Re-checks: 0)*
  Continue scoping/assessing UI shifts and changes to the rest of the app,
  following on from the UI/UX Overhaul and Card UI Polish milestones (see
  `MILESTONES.md`). Open-ended — needs a pass identifying which
  screens/components haven't had a UI-focused pass yet before it turns
  into concrete legs.

## Future Milestones (unscheduled)

2026-09-10 feedback pass batched into 4 candidate milestones; Battle Logger
Overhaul, Statistics Improvements, and Team Management QoL were each
promoted to current and have since shipped (see `MILESTONES.md`). Live Calc
Tuning, the last of the four, was promoted 2026-09-11 and later retired in
favor of Regular Calc Popup (see `MILESTONES.md`). VGCPastes real-set
sourcing, deferred out of Regular Calc Popup, was itself promoted to
current 2026-09-14 and shipped 2026-09-15 (see `MILESTONES.md`).

Two fast-follows deferred out of Web Version: Teams & Box MVP's scoping
(2026-09-29, see `docs/investigations/web-version-scope.md`) - not yet
worth their own legs until the MVP milestone ships:
- Password reset flow (needs a transactional email API + SPF/DKIM
  deliverability setup on a dedicated vannyproductions.com subdomain).
- Public profile / team-sharing pages (the account model's username design
  already accommodates this, but the public routes/per-team visibility
  toggle need their own scoping pass). Scope widened 2026-09-29 (Vanny) to
  cover profile search and a shared team database where users can upload
  teams for others to browse in-app, not just per-team visibility toggles -
  needs a privacy-model decision (what's public by default) and abuse/
  moderation considerations for a public upload database before it's ready
  to scope into legs.

Download/landing page for choicebuds.vannyproductions.com (proposed
2026-09-29, out of Web Hosting & Domain's Leg 1): make the new site the
default download entry point instead of sending people straight to the
GitHub Releases page. No universal/self-fetching installer needed - a page
calling `api.github.com/repos/vanwheels/ChoiceBuds/releases/latest` (the
same call `services/github.ts`'s in-app update checker already makes) and
linking to that release's OS-appropriate asset is enough; GitHub Releases
stays the actual file host. Needs its own scoping pass (OS detection UI,
where the page lives relative to the app shell, page design) - not yet
worth a leg on its own.

General web content-area padding gap (flagged 2026-09-30 by Vanny during
live verification of Battle Log & Statistics Parity): `AppWeb.tsx`'s
`<main>` has no padding at all, unlike `App.tsx`'s desktop `<main>`
(2rem/1.5rem inline styles), so ported pages render edge-to-edge in the
browser - visible on the Battle Log page's card grid butting against the
viewport edges. Distinct from the mobile-friendliness pass above (that one's
about touch/breakpoints for phone-sized viewports; this is a plain desktop-
browser layout gap). Not fixed now per Vanny's call to worry about it later
- likely a quick fix (mirror `App.tsx`'s `<main>` padding) whenever a web UI
polish pass happens, but worth confirming it doesn't collide with any
page's own assumption that `<main>` has zero padding first.

Teams tab search bar (proposed 2026-09-29): search for a specific Pokémon
by name and surface which of the user's saved teams include it. Needs its
own scoping pass (exact vs. partial name match, whether it also searches
the Box or is Teams-only, UI placement) - not yet worth a leg.

Battle Logging: special events / Global Challenge (proposed 2026-09-29):
let a logged battle be tagged to a specific event so a user can filter/
view matches for that event specifically. Global Challenge is online,
dated, and officially endorsed by The Pokémon Company, so it's a plausible
source of truth to track. In-person Regionals are also official but (a)
there's no clear source for a complete/reliable schedule to pull from and
(b) players are unlikely to log in-person tournament games in the app
anyway (no external devices allowed at the event), so Regionals may not be
worth pursuing even once scoped. Open question from Vanny that needs a
decision before this can be scoped further: let users freeform-create
their own named events, vs. only tracking a curated list of official ones
(e.g. just GC).
